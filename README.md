# population-growth-simulation

- I have created an ecosystem with eight species (Tigers, Bears, Grass, Trees, Bugs, Buffaloes, Birds, Chickens), that all interact with each other.
- The simulation code, main.py is run over n steps (time is discrete), and the plot of final population is is showed at the end of the simulation.
- For more information you can see the project report "Report.pdf".
